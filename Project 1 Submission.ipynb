    "## Logic (or lack thereof) behind approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Through some trials (refer to \"Project 1 Trials and Notes\" ipynb file), I found my ideal approach to find the top banks with the best money/time ratios. Through multiple trials, I found the ideal number of options for my approach to be between 150-200 banks; I went with 200 banks. Then I used random to go through the banks with np.random.randint to arbitrarily select banks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program will go through banks and add them to a pathway whilst keeping track of time. Once the time hits just under 24 hours, the program \"breaks\" the current iteration and appends the path, the money gains, and the time spent to different lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "This occurs a near infinite number of times until the while loop is forced to stop via the time-lapse \"if-statement\" set up in the beginning of the loop. Finally, the program selects the path with the highest gains and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flaws\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest and most obvious flaw of this is that there is basically no repeatability, since the program goes through a list of 200 banks randomly and stopping just shy of 24 hours. The likelihood of getting the same answer twice in a row (given the 3 minute run-time restriction) is basically impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, if there was no time limit, there would be no need to isolate the maximum money/hour as you could run all possible pathways ignoring processing time and always get the same (best possible) response. However, based on my various trials, I have come to find that the money value I get with this strategy hovers around $6,500,000. So while there's no real repeatability based on the restrictions set in place, there is some level of consistency."
